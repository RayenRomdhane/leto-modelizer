Feature: Test modelizer text view: create file and folder

  Background:
    Given I clear cache
    And I set context field "repository_url" with "https://github.com/ditrit/leto-modelizer-project-test"
    And I set context field "projectName" with "leto-modelizer-project-test"
    And I visit the "/"

    When I click on "[data-cy=\"import-project\"]"
    And  I set on "[data-cy=\"import-project-form\"] [data-cy=\"git-repository-input\"]" text "{{ repository_url }}"
    And  I set on "[data-cy=\"import-project-form\"] [data-cy=\"git-username-input\"]" text "test"
    And  I set on "[data-cy=\"import-project-form\"] [data-cy=\"git-token-input\"]" text "test"
    And  I click on "[data-cy=\"import-project-form\"] [data-cy=\"import-project-form-submit\"]"
    Then I expect "positive" toast to appear with text "Project has been imported ðŸ¥³!"
    And  I expect "[data-cy=\"import-project-form\"]" is closed
    And  I expect current url is "modelizer/{{ projectName }}/model"
    And  I expect "[data-cy=\"project-name\"]" is "{{ projectName }}"

    When I visit the "/#/modelizer/{{projectName}}/text"
    Then I expect "[data-cy=\"file-explorer\"] [data-cy=\"file-label-{{ projectName }}\"]" exists
    And  I wait 2 seconds

  Scenario: Create a file inside the root folder should expand the root folder and open corresponding active tab
    When I hover "[data-cy=\"file-explorer\"] [data-cy=\"file-explorer-buttons-{{ projectName }}\"]" to make it visible
    And  I click on "[data-cy=\"file-explorer\"] [data-cy=\"file-explorer-buttons-{{ projectName }}\"]"

    Then I expect "positive" toast to appear with text "File is created &#129395;!"
    And  I expect "[data-cy=\"create-file-form\"]" is closed
    #  New active tab is open with created file's label

    And  I expect "[data-cy=\"file-tabs-container\"] [data-cy=\"active-tab\"]" is "newFile.js"
    #  Created file is added inside file explorer and file tabs

  Scenario: Create a file inside sub-folder should open corresponding active tab and expand the parent folder
